x- Welcome Message  - As a customer, I would like to see a welcome message when I start the
    application, so that I feel welcome and know that Biblioteca is available.
x- List Books - As a customer, after the welcome message appears
    I would like to see a list of all library books, so that
    I can browse for books I might want to check-out.
    Assume that there is a pre-existing list of books.
    You don't need to support adding or removing books from the library.
x- Book Details - As a customer, I'd like the list of all books to include
    each books Author and Year Published, so that I can be confident
    that I have found the book I am looking for. The book listing should
    have columns for this information.

    x-prints 3 columns
x- Main Menu  - As a customer, instead of automatically seeing the book list,
    I would like to see a list of options and be able to choose one. For now,
    the only option should be 'List Books'. All future options should be added
    to this menu also.
    x print "List Books"
    x if types "1" -> execute list books
- Invalid Menu Option - As a customer, I would like to be notified when I
    choose an invalid option with the message “Select a valid option!”,
    so that I can know when I need to re-enter my choice.

    x- move forward when is correct option

    choose to 'Quit'.

    X-second select quit after selecting list books (can choose 1 or 2 at every point)

    check-out a book. Checked out books should not appear in the list
    of all library books.
    x-should be asked to checkout book
    x-customers_books should exist
    x-cusbk should be added from book list
        x-add to cusbk
        x-delete from booklist
    x-cusbk not contain any in bookList
x- Successful Checkout - As a customer, I would like to know that a book
    has been checked out by seeing the message “Thank you! Enjoy the book”.
x- Unsuccessful Checkout - As a customer, I would like to be notified if the
    book I tried to check-out is not available by seeing the message, “That
    book is not available.”, so that I know that I need to select a
    different book or fix my spelling error.
- Return Book - As a librarian, I would like customers to be able to return
    a book, so that other customers can check that book out. Returned books
    should appear in the list of library books.

    x- should click to enter, and display list of checked books
    x- method should remove book from cust books

    - bad operation -> bad msg
- Successful Return - As a customer, I would like to be notified if the
    book I am returning belongs to this library by seeing the message,
    “Thank you for returning the book.”, so that I know I returned the
    book to the right library.
- Unsuccessful Return - As a customer, I would like to be notified if the
    book I am returning has not been added to this library by seeing the
    message, “That is not a valid book to return.”, so that I can return
    it to the correct library or fix my spelling error.

    urgent issues
    9. mainMenuSelect is testing 3 menu options -> decouple and test these singly! then have ONE integration test.
     You are mixing integration and unit testing
    10. should integration test from beginning

    issues:
    2. go is not tested
    5. selectMenu(getInput()); move get input to inside selectMenu
    6. test doesnt check exit after "bye!"
    7. bookList should be mocked in test -> ie. adding more books to actual book list shouldnt break tests
    8. first get back to work, then get the great gatsby to function
    9. test that "select book to checkout" gives error when book not found
    10. asks for numbers in main menu and name of book/back in book list menu
    11. could make printBookList private, IF can find a way to test in isolation. (maybe wrap it?)
    12 rename bookLIst
    13. mainMenuMessage shows up a lot -> should remove and test once
